# JavaScript fetch() Lab

## Objectives

1. Use `fetch()` to get remote data from GitHub
2. Use `fethc()` to write data to GitHub

## Introduction

Make sure students understand the ins and outs of `fetch()` -- e.g., the options object, headers, etc.

Walk students through signing up for a GitHub auth token (click avatar in upper right, click "Settings", "click "Personal access tokens" on the side bar, generate a new token)

Have students practice creating issues on a repository (it could even be _this_ repository)

For the tests, redefine a global fetch as a spy and make sure that the student's functions are calling the right endpoint(s)
